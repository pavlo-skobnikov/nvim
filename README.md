# nvim

I use Neovim mostly through the
[VSCode's Neovim extension](https://github.com/vscode-neovim/vscode-neovim) and less so through
terminal emulator.

If you're curious, you can start exploring my configuration in the following places:

- [the init file](./.config/nvim/init.lua).
- [basic configurations](./.config/nvim/plugin/).
- [custom plugins file](./.config/nvim/lua/custom/).

> NOTE TO SELF: Don't rice too much. It's a waste of time. Focus on the work, not the tools.
