# nvim

Configuration for my weapon of choice, Neovim. If you're curious, you can start exploring my 
configuration in the following places:
- [the init file](./.config/nvim/init.lua).
- [basic configurations](./.config/nvim/plugin/).
- [custom plugins directory](./.config/nvim/lua/custom/plugins/).

> NOTE TO SELF: Don't rice too much. It's a waste of time. Focus on the work, not the tools.
